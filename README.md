# Wacoom_Tablet_Mapping_Script
This is a short script I've created to automate the process of mapping my Wacoom tablet to the shortcut keys that bring my joy. :)

This is not always needed, but it depends on the OS you're running... I'm running a variant of Ubuntu, which is PopOS! and for some reason it's not automagically remapping my shortcut keys when restarting. 

So... I've decided to automagically do it myself with this script.
